Triumvirate of Hearts v.0.1
	Management

Select any action (from 0 to 5) by entering the desired number in the input line. Then you look at your ladyâ€™s reaction, if it is positive (i.e. you received a point), then you have guessed one of her character traits and can continue to use this action. But remember that you can use it no more than 2 times! Next time (3) she will simply refuse and you will lose points as if you had chosen an action that she would have rated negatively. You can also learn from your opponent's mistakes or successes.
